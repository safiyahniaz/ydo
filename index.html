            Greenhouse gases can stay in the atmosphere for an amount of years ranging from decades to hundreds and thousands of years. That is the major reason to explain for ozone layer hole. Ozone depletion is the main cause which leads to climate change or also called global warming.

            The Consequences of Inaction 
        </h3>

        <ol id="What">
            <li>Pressures on the planet’s ecosystem are now so great that future generations could face falling living standards. </li>
            <li>Air pollution alone will be a major killer, overtaking both poor sanitation and a lack of clean drinking water as a global health threat. </li>              
            <li> Due to dependence on fossil fuels, carbon dioxide emissions from energy use will grow by 70%, the OECD found. This will help drive up the global average temperature by 3° to 6 ° Celsius by 2100. Not only does this far exceed the internationally agreed-upon global warming limit of two degrees, but three degrees may be the “tipping point” where climate change could run out of control, scientists say. </li>
            <li> Because the population will grow so dramatically, there will be a 55% increase in demand for water, and 40% of the world’s population will be living under severe water stress. </li>
            <li> Groundwater depletion will be the biggest threat to agriculture and to urban water supplies, while pollution from sewage and waste water—including chemicals used in cleaning—will put further strain on global water supplies.</li>

            Solutions to global environmental crisis 
          </h3>
 
          
          <ol>
          <li id="dog"> Environmentally-friendly forms of transport. 
              <p id="What2">If more people are using public transport, this would reduce the amount of pollution.</p> 
            </li>
            <li id="dog">  Recycling waste.
              <p id="What2">Although we try to reduce the amount of wastes, it’s undeniable that there are still large numbers of wastes dumped into landfills and contaminating the environment everyday. Hence, recycling waste appears to be the best solution for remained wastes. </p> 
            </li>
            <li id="dog"> Education.
              <p id="What2">  People should be aware of environmental alarm and take more responsibilities for environment crisis.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="dog">Replace disposable items with reusable ones.
              <p id="What2"> Some changes you can make are carrying your own reusable cup or water bottle, using reusable food containers instead of sandwich bags and plastic wrap, and bringing your own bags to the grocery store.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="dog"> Reducing paper wastage.
              <p id="What2"> Print as little as possible; and if you must, print on both sides.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="dog"> Conserve water & electricity
              <p id="What2"> Turn the sink water off when brushing your teeth, switch off anything that uses electricity when not in use (lights, televisions, computers, printers, etc.), unplug devices when possible; even when an appliance is turned off, it may still use power.</p>
            </li>
